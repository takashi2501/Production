The primary languages of the programs in "Production" are MATLAB, C, and Arduino; MATLAB is version R2023a, C is the Ubuntu virtual environment, and Arduino is used as is.

As a description of each folder,  
MATLAB:  
"biological system" is a modeling and simulation program for biological systems.  
"gendai" is a modeling and simulation program based on modern control theory.  
"non-liner2" is a modeling and simulation program for nonlinear systems.  
"Robot_sencer" is a parity check program using MATLAB and a conversion program between gray code and binary code.  

C:  
"Programming Basics" is a PDF file of programs from basics to applications created in a university class.  

Arduino:  
"PBL_PK", "PBL2_Performance", and "PBL2_Walking" are functional programs for robots created in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) classes at university.  

As for the C language, the environment is 4 years old, so my PC does not have it and I cannot run it now. Arduino is also not available because it requires a microcontroller.
